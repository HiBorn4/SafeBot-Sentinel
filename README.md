## Introduction
Detecting and labeling persons in video footage is crucial for various applications such as surveillance, security, and analytics. Traditional methods can be slow and inaccurate. This project uses a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model, enhanced with transfer learning, to accurately detect and label persons in video footage.

## Features
- Utilizes YOLOv8 for high-accuracy object detection.
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models for improved performance.
- Supports VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 backbones.
- GPU acceleration for faster processing.
- Generates annotated video outputs for visualization.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HiBorn4/person-detection-yolov8.git
    cd person-detection-yolov8
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
### Running the Model
1. **Place your video files in the `videos` folder.**

2. **Run the script to process the video:**
    ```python
    import os
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    import supervision as sv
    import numpy as np

    # Define the paths
    VIDEO_PATH = "videos/D01_20240522173959.mp4"
    MODEL_PATH = "8s/detect/train3/weights/best.pt"
    RESULT_VIDEO_PATH = "results/result.mp4"

    # Load the model
    model = YOLO(MODEL_PATH)

    # Process each frame
    def process_frame(frame: np.ndarray, _) -> np.ndarray:
        results = model(frame, imgsz=1280)[0]
        boxes = results.xyxy[:, :4].cpu().numpy()
        confidences = results.xyxy[:, 4].cpu().numpy()
        class_ids = results.xyxy[:, 5].cpu().numpy().astype(int)

        detections = sv.Detections(xyxy=boxes, confidence=confidences, class_id=class_ids)
        box_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator(thickness=4, text_thickness=2, text_scale=1.5)
        labels = [f"{model.names[class_id]} {confidence:.2f}" for class_id, confidence in zip(class_ids, confidences)]
        frame = box_annotator.annotate(scene=frame, detections=detections, labels=labels)

        return frame

    # Process the video
    sv.process_video(source_path=VIDEO_PATH, target_path=RESULT_VIDEO_PATH, callback=process_frame)
    ```

## Training the Model
To train the model from scratch or fine-tune it with your custom dataset:
```sh
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=path/to/data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=800 plots=True device=0
```

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model and check its accuracy:
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO("best.pt")

# Evaluate the model on the validation dataset
results = model.val(data="data.yaml")

# Print the results
print(results)
```

## Results
Here is an example of the output video with detected and labeled persons:
